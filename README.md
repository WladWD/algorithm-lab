# algorithm-lab
Algorithm lab — a personal collection of classic and modern algorithms implemented in C++ with real-world examples and performance profiling using Google Benchmark. The goal is to combine algorithmic clarity, modern C++ design, and measurable performance — bridging academic knowledge with production-level efficiency.
